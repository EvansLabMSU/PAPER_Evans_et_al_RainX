# Column information for the "Biomass_AssignZerotoNeg.csv" and "RainX ECO metafile_se_forR.csv"

## Biomass_AssignZerotoNeg.csv
```
SAMPLE ID- Unique numerical ID for each soil sample with unique trt and replicate combination.
Label_ID- Treatment and rep, abbreviated by letter codes. C/S=Clay or Sand, R/S=Rain or Sterile treatment, R/A=Reduced or Ambient rainfall
Trt- Identifies if sample is a part of the main treatments or controls (trt- Soils collected at the end of the experiment, stl- Autoclave sterilized soils collected at the end of the experiment, t0- soil samples collected at beginning of experiment and archived to represent initial community)
Rain Trt- How much water soils received. Ambient= ambient amount of rainfall. Reduced= drought treatment, 25% of ambient	
Disp Trt- Whether the soil received rain water with microbes (nonsterile- unfiltered rain, sterile- rain filtered with 0.22 µm filter)
Soil- Two soil types (clay- higher percentage of clay, sand- higher percentage of sand)
MB TN ug_g_dry- Microbial biomass in the form of carbon (ug per g of dry soil)
MB POC ug_g_dry- Microbial biomass in the form of nitrogen (ug per g of dry soil)

## RainX ECO metafile_se_forR.csv

```
SampleID- Unique numerical ID for each soil sample with unique trt and replicate combination.  These repeat because there are 32 substrates for each
LabelID- Treatment and rep, abbreviated by letter codes. C/S=Clay or Sand, R/S=Rain or Sterile treatment, R/A=Reduced or Ambient rainfall
Rain Trt- How much water soils received. Ambient= ambient amount of rainfall. Reduced= drought treatment, 25% of ambient
Disp Trt- Whether the soil received rain water with microbes (Nonsterile- unfiltered rain, Sterile- rain filtered with 0.22 µm filter)
Soil- Two soil types (clay- higher percentage of clay, sand- higher percentage of sand)
CarbonSource- Substrate provided for ECOLOG plate
Final- Relative absorbance measurement, as an indicator of substrate use. See manuscript Methods and Rutgers et al.(2006) for details on calculating this number.
